				<h3>Welcome!</h3>			
				<p> I hope you're having a great <?php echo date('l'); ?>. It has truly been a pleasure playing
				<em>jazz guitar</em> over the years with my friends in Colorado. This spontaneous music is always inspiring.</p> 
				<p>I have been fortunate to play with many talented
				folks in the area and am excited about what lies ahead. I
				perform with several groups based in Fort Collins, Colorado. I 
				work frequently with a trio of guitar, bass, and drums 
				and also take pleasure in performing solo.</p>
				<p>I hope you enjoy browsing the site. I especially hope you like the sound and video clips included on the music page. </p>
